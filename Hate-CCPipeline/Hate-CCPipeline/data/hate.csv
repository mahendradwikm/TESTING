"A few months ago I was in the tube sitting down ready to go and meet my friends and out of nowhereI was confronted by a man who came in and started to shout at me asking me to ""go back to (my) country"".This isn't something new that I've encountered because I'm Asian and I don't typically look like the people who apparently ""own"" this country.I remember being so upset and angry but I held back from saying anything because I was alone (and a female) and I cared for my safety more than defending myself to a racist.",1

"As a retired person i have plenty of time to browse on facebook and other social media sites to keep in touch with family and friends.I used to comment news and recently i have commented an Ukrainian-Russian war related post.I have raised my voice against military supply for Ukraine because by weapons they will escalate the war that will be resulting in more death, suffering and it is not a good idea to play with the fire as Russia can use nuclear bomb.Well President Zelensky is still very popular in the west and i ve received a very ugly comment calling me stupid idiot bitch, named me as i was a russian spy and this person was totally against peace but war and destruction",1

During my jobs in a clothes store a customer behaved negatively towards me following an item not being in stock.The customer expressed that it wasn’t good enough and blamed me for the time not being available.This led me to be frustrated as I was trying my best to explain that it was not my fault and the items will come back into stock.Despite the negative encounter this helped me handle myself better even if I felt negatively about myself in the moment.,1

"I have just had a new bed delivered and it was assembled by two men.They asked me to check I was happy, I noticed they had scraped the wall in the bedroom.The wall was freshly painted so I was unhappy, and I am refusing to sign the form they wanted me to sign to say they had assembled it fine.One of them has just left, and the other one is speaking to me rudely and insisting I sign the form and that the marks on the wall were not made by them.I am calmly trying to explain that they weren't there before and he's laughing at me and brushing me off and saying I didn't know that for sure, and I need to sign his form.It keeps going back and forth like thisand he's raising his voice to me in my own home.I have asked him to leave and he won't, insisting I signed his form.I am upset but trying to be calm as his hands are flying around and I feel that if I pushed the situation further he could potentially become violent.Eventually he has given up and I held my ground by not signing the form and as he leaves I tell him I will raise a formal complaint.",1
I have repaired a gate that gives access to a field next to my house.A dog walker who uses the field has deliberately broken the repair.I am furious and am confronting him.He says I had no right to undertake the repair as it is not my business and it makes the gate harder to open.We are both yelling at each other.He will not listen to my reasoning.I am shaking with rage and can only just refrain from physically attacking him.,1

"I once was on a train going home from work & and drunk guy ( drinking as he had a beer in his hand ) was on the train with 2 of his friends.I came onto the train and he made a racist remark but I ignored it and sat down, I didn’t take much notice as I was excited I was going on holiday the next day so was not letting anything annoy me.He then started shouting over to me asking if the next stop was partick and I ignored him and then he said she probably doesn’t speak English to which I lost it and said no I do speak English but why would I acknowledge a drunk rude person like yourself.He then lost the plot and stood up over me and said watch who your talking to or I will punch your packi nose.A random stranger stood up for me and said don’t talk to her like that and the drunk guy ended up hitting the guy that stood up for me with the beer bottle that was in his hand.Police got involved and the guy was sent to jail as he was already out on bail.Over I am happy someone was there to help me in",1

I was taking a ceiling light back to the shops that I had purchased the day before as it was faulty due to a part missing.The shop assistant questioned whether I had used the item and I replied no because there were parts missing.The shop assistant was then very rude and accused me of using the item and bringing it back to her a refund.I reiterated that I had only purchased the item the day before but she proceeded to be extremely rude to me.I was quite upset by this so I asked to speak to her Manager to deal with my complaint.,1

It was when I had not long had my car and I was still getting used to driving it.I was on a narrow country land and along a long section there were roadworks.The traffic lights at the road works changed to red on my side so i stopped and waited.A big queue of traffic built up behind me and when the lights changed I unfortunatly stalled the car as i was not familiar with it at that stage and could not start it again until the lights had changed back to red.This caused many toots of horns from people behind me and some shouting when we finally got moving.I felt awful and embarrassed to be in that situation and felt that everyone must be thinking I was a useless woman driver who should not be on the road.It made me quite upset and I couldn't wait to get started again so people behind me could overtake me and leave me alone.,1

"My friend was in a relationship with an older man.I and the rest of our friendship group did not like this man.We thought he was a controlling oddball and we did not understand why she was in a relationship with this man.We would sometimes go out socially with this man, and as time went on he became less engaged with the group and increasingly rude.One evening, we were all on the pavement outside his house, discussing what we were to do with the rest of our evening.My friend said she thought she would go and spend time in this man's house and I said something along the lines of 'Aww, we'll miss you, come to the pub with us.""And the man looked at me and said ""You're a fucking bitch"".I didn't say anything in response, but probably pulled a face that showed displeasure.We parted ways then.",1
"My male supervisor addressed me as 'her' in front of my other colleagues.It was in an open plan office.Another of my colleagues asked who had put the folders on the table and my boss said 'her' aggressively and rudely and pointed over to me.I felt that this was an unacceptable way of addressing me, he should have at least used my name.I felt disappointed and slightly upset.I was the only female in the office also so it felt like sexism to me.",1
"One evening when I was leaving work and ending a phone call with a client, he wasn't happy with the premium or my reasonings in why the company offered could no longer stand over the price.He called me an idiot and quite abruptly ended the call.I continued to put my notes on the policy but as it was an l extremely busy day with lots of complications and issues it made me feel totally inadequent.I questioned my job and consoder3d leaving",1
"potentially someone at work could call me an idiot if I made a mistake, this could happen if they were under a lot of pressure, stressed or simply didn't favour me as much as the other colleagues.it would upset me, especially if it was a colleague I got on with, it would change my feelings towards them.It would also make me feel embarrassed that I had made the mistake In the first place, and if I was called it in-front of others.the work we do is important and I understand that mistakes can be crucial towards our results.",0
"Recently at work I'd booked some travel for a colleague to come from London to Manchester for 2 days of Senior Staff Training.There were 2 training sessions taking place and he asked to be booked on the same train as another colleague I'd just booked them for.However he hadn't looked at which training session he'd been booked on and had asked me to book the trains on the wrong dates.He attempted to blame me and said he'd assumed I knew which training session he was in, which I didn't and told me to change the trains.The mistake was completely his and he took no responsibility and tried to blame me.I thought he was rude, because he didn't apologise, he made it seem like it was my fault and made me resolve the issue.",1
"so one night many years ago, i was out with one of my friends in a bar in our local town.For some reason these 2 women (one was an older women and the other younger women was actually her daughter) took a disliking to my friend.Now my friend is quite loud and in your face, very marmite!Anyway they started to push and shove my friend and create an argument.My friend walked off, and i tried to calm the situation with the two women in which the old woman said F**k off you fat b*tch, go eat a burger blah blah.Just full on laying into me for no reason at all.(by the way i was a size 12 so wasn't even fat!).I felt hurt, and sad!That one of the worst things you can say to a young girl who is riddled with insecurities.And it totally ruined my night.",1
The last time I recall being addressed with sexist language was during my divorce.My then husband wanted to reconcile and I did not.We had tried counselling but I had made my mind up and wanted a divorce.Once my then husband realised that he would not be able to get his way this time he resorted to insults and trying to restrict me financially and called me various sexist names such as bitch and cow.I was upset at the names he called mebut I also understood that that he was doing it because he was hurt and angry.,1
"The last time I was addressed with a sexist slur was when I was in the playground at secondary school.I was with a group of people.Another group of girls started walking by.One of them stared at me as they walked by.I looked back and then looked away.That same girl said 'what are you staring at, bitch?'The group of people she was with started laughing.I turned away and they began to walk away.The people I was with started asking me if I was ok.I started feeling very upset and embarrassed that this happened to me and wondered why I was their target and not anybody else.I decided not to tell anyone, like a teacher, what had happened.",1
"There was a young woman with her child on the bus.A man started to be very aggressive towards her because her baby was crying.I tried to intervene as no one was protecting them or taking their defense.This man started to insult me and telling me it wasn't my business, why I was getting involved and calling me racial slur and a slag.",1
"They are shouting at me, instead of addressing me politely and with an appropriate tone of voice.",0
"This was a conversation with a previous partner.We were involved in a quarrel but prior to this point there had been no personal insults.I do not use personal insults during conflict.They used the term ""f***ing idiot"".I found it disrespectful and deeply upsetting.This was something that couldn't be taken back.",1
Two days ago my sister in law came and said ver hurtful words to me and made me cry and she was fooled by someone who wanted us to split and after hearing those allegation I am heart broken and I am feeling very sad but because I am innocent and I am not feeling guilty and time will uncover truth but at the moment nothing can erase her anger because she is the person who does not forgive and thi,1
Wasnt me personally but witnessed a savage attack between 2 women.shouting and name calling over a complete misunderstanding.neither would back down and situation just escalated.Finally the one being shouted at walked away visibly shaking and upset.the embarrasment and humiliation could be seen.,0
When I was younger I was getting ready to go out and my sister came into my room.I was wearing a new top that I'd bought recently and my sister said I shouldn't wear it because I was too fat.I told her she was a cow and she said I was bitch and that she was only joking and not to take things too seriously.I felt really bad about myself because she always knocks my confidence and there was no need for her to call me a bitch.She often insulted me with these type of words and then would say that she was only teasing but I don't think there was any need for itand it would be easier if she would just be nice and not say these mean things.After she called me a bitch I told her to get out of my room and leave me alone because she really gets on my nerves.,1
"while parking at a doctors office,
i pulled into a free bay not realising that 
someone was already waiting for that space.Once i had parked i reied to say sorry as i could
see the person was angry,and even though
there were other parking spaces available they
still called me a dickhead which i thought wasnt
very nice.It was after all a genuine mistake on 
my park and i had said sorrybut this person was
in such a foul mood i could not calm them down.",1
"While them exact words weren't used, I am in a situation where similar words are close to being used.I am in college and I have had a big falling out with my best friend due to her putting myself and my family in danger.I am angry and I'm telling her I can't risk the danger againso I'm telling her I need time away from her, and I am removing her from my social medias to avoid further conflict, in which she is sending me extremely angry messages now saying awful things to me.",0
"Whilst sitting with my husband and sister in law, my sister in law started to explain that she is starting to feed her 5 month old with purées.I began to give my thoughts on baby led weening rather than purées and perhaps she should wait till her baby was 6 months.However she soon turned around and said “I wasn’t asking for your opinion”

She completely shut me down without letting me explain the research I had already done prior to this.She made me feel very belittled",1
"Yesterday I was shopping in Co-Op and I had a voucher to scan for 25p off my purchase, which was sent to me in an email.I bought some bits and tried to scan the voucher at the self service till, it did not work so one of the shop staff came to help.Normally they are lovely staff but this person I think was new, and he kept telling me to just scan it, which is what I was doing but it did not work.He then came over and basically said ‘it’s only 25p, what’s the problem if it does not scan’, which was upsetting as well as rude.I normally am very calm but I was not feeling very wellso I said to him that he must get it to work, so he grabbed my phone with the voucher and tutted and grumbled whilst trying to get it to work.It did eventually work, but he was so rude it really upset me - and  maybe to him 25p isn’t much but to me every penny counts.",1
"Yesterday I was sitting with my husband and he had a lot of scratched scabs on his forehead, I told him he needs to stop picking at them because it looks like he has been doing drugs or something.He got upset and I said I’mI didn’t mean it in a rude way but he shouldn’t be scratching his face like that.He then looked me up and down and said okay gaunt face.I didn’t know what gaunt meant so I looked it up and it means haggard.I felt really sad because I have a new born and am so self conscious of my looks because I can’t sleep most nights.It was depressing and I shut down immediately and was sad.",1
"""Fortunately"" the insult didn't happen live, in the sense that I usually do live shows on social media and it happened to be the stranger on duty who offended me because I didn't accept the explicit requests he made of me.I didn't feel too shocked because, I repeat, it was one of the classic keyboard lions and because it didn't happen to me personally.Maybe in that situation it would have been different but I'm lucky because it's never happened to me.",1
"in elementary school, while doing math exercises, the teacher gave my male partner who had just finished (before the others) a more difficult exercise, but didn't give it to me who had finished shortly after him because I was less intelligent in general than him and so I didn't deserve to",1
"Entirely male environmentso guyI'm quite sorry and dismayed and I reply ""It's not correct"".I hear the answer that if the wife had ever tried to say it again, she would have thrown X-rated food at her complete with ""You are all bitches, you must be kept in the kennel"".I get angry and feel helpless and inferior, even though objectively her behavior is incorrect and ignorant from many points of view.I have nothing more to add because I feel that anything could be perceived as heavy-handed and moralistic by others present.",1
"As soon as I got on the train I was trying to put my suitcase under the seats when a lady told me ""I doubt it would fit there"", and I was convinced that it would fitand I continued to put it under the seatand I heard the lady say ""how stupid"".So I turn around and look at the lady and ask her why she cares what she does with my suitcase and to think about how stupid she is.",1
"I was 12 years old and I lived in a very degraded area where I attended middle school.The males were all already knowledgeable, they had adult behaviors and knew terms and things that I, still a child, didn't know.They understood that I didn't know the term ""cocksucker"".And then they started yelling it at me all the time.Everywhere, as soon as I passed I would say ""hello pompinaraaa"".I was ashamed, but then I went to find out what it meant when I got home (there were no smartphones at the time).And there I felt myself dying of shame.I felt like a naive imbecile for not understanding what was being shouted at me throughout the school.I don't remember how the matter was resolved, but the memory of middle school still generates in me a sense of shame, inadequacy, discomfort, ... it was horrible.The more ashamed I was, the more they shouted it at me.And I was helpless, I didn't know how to defend myself.",1
"there is traffic.The light turns green, I sound the horn because the one in front of me, who was coming from the other road at the intersection, was obstructing my passage and could have moved a little to make room for me.I am insulted with the invitation to stay calm (even though that calm was me and not her), because ""where do you want to go anyway"".I don't understand why we have to say things in certain aggressive tones, but as soon as I can I'll stop and move on.",1
"I call my colleague, a little older than me, area manager (but not my superior) and husband of the boss's daughter.I call him to let him know that a customer has arrived that he should take care of.This is usually one of my clients, that's why the secretary notified me.Initially he doesn't answer me anything, he stays silent.So I ask him if he wanted me to pick up the customer and bring him to him, he doesn't answer.So I ask him if he's going and he replies that he doesn't go to pick up anyone.He tells me to keep doing my job and gets in my face.I was shocked, but I let it go.After a few minutes he comes to my office, he asks me ""So?"" and I reply, ""Look Paolo, I just wanted to let you know that the customer had arrived, that's all.""There is noise from machinery running in the background.then I repeat the same sentence to him.",1
"it would depend on the situation to outline my reaction.I would certainly get very angry, I would equally certainly take action especially if it involved insults made in the presence of witnesses (e.g. a complaint).For example, if I were in the workplace and someone dared to address me with an epithet like this (a colleague?)I would demand his head from the management, consulting the figures responsible for reports of this kind.However, if it were an argument in the street, I would make sure I had witnesses and then I would proceed to collect the useful clues to identify the person, to proceed with a complaint for insults and related damages.I've never had a situation like this happen to me and, although I know more or less how I could behave, I don't rule out that anger would paralyze me and prevent me from thinking clearly in the moment.I exclude that I would react with as many insults so as not to be on the wrong side.",0
"After a few months of breaking up with my ex, I got engaged to another guy.When I posted the photos of me and him on social media, my partner, who I hadn't heard from in months, started commenting insulting me, saying that I'm a slut and that I have a ""big ass"".Well aware of my and his being overweight, I preferred not to encourage him and block him on all social networks without replying to him, feeling superior to his insults.",1
"during an internship in a hospital in the province of Padua (I don't want to specify where)I approached the patient's bed to explain what was happening and what nursing procedure I was about to implement.Next to me was the nurse on duty to whom I had been assigned to supervise my work.while I was speaking I was abruptly interrupted by the patient in the next bed who insulted me numerous times.I didn't give it much weight, but that case stuck with me because the patient who insulted me was alert and oriented.the cause of his anger was because I had ruined his rest with my voice..",1
"It's summer, I'm at a birthday party for a friend from the sea who I haven't seen for a long time.The relationship has weakened over the years, and especially in recent times.Months earlier I had had a one night stand with one of her ex-boyfriends, I didn't tell her anything.I try to get away from the birthday party as quickly as possible, I don't feel comfortable in this situation.Before going, she asks me to do them",1
"It's my grandmother's birthday and my sister and I are eating at her house.My sister had brought broccoli and my grandmother got angry because we shouldn't eat that vegetable.from there my grandmother starts yelling at us, using heavy insults, I let my sister talk and I listen.at a certain point my grandmother starts picking on me, telling me that I'm good for nothing.",1
"and I just went to a concert with a friend of mine.we are leaving the area where the concert was held and we are surrounded by hundreds of people.at a certain point the line stops and I bump into a boy's back.I apologize immediately but he turns and looks at me angrily and says 'look where you're going, you're stupid' and his friends start laughing.I was too surprised to answer and at that point the line started flowing again and that boy disappeared.I felt humiliated and offended",1
"It happened about a year and a half ago, I had a childish argument with my best friend, I had known her for 20 years...We hadn't spoken for a week when it happened, I looked for her to clarify, but I knew it wasn't my fault.She spoke to me brutally, it broke my heart.In reality my first reaction was anger, I responded with sarcasm, but she just felt more bold and continued with the insults.I felt terrible for months, to this day I haven't gotten over it since we haven't spoken since then.",1
"It happened several times while I was studying at the Conservatory; specifically there is this teacher with whom I am doing an exercise, I play together with the singer, who leaves out of time after my introduction to the piano.Instead of reiterating the time and making us start from scratch, she responds badly to me, telling me that the mistake was mine, when the situation was more than obvious.I tried to pretend nothing had happened, but at that moment I wanted to sink, or run away.I knew rationally that she was wrong, but internally I felt deeply ashamed.",1
It happened during an evening at the disco when I didn't give in to a boy who continued to follow me throughout the evening.,1
"It happened while I was walking
It was a weekendA van with 3 men called me whistling with offensive words
I felt very offended and angry
I thought for a moment about answering them badly and insulting thembut then I thought that I wouldn't stoop to their levels and I ignored them
I kept walking and pretended nothing happened
Every time this happens I now ignore everyone and the situation in general",1
"It has happened more than a few times that I have received sexist insults of this type, that is, not veiled and direct.The last time shocked me because there was no relation between the slur ""bitch"" and what was going on.I'm on Erasmus, we were in the party room and I was playing music, there were people from various parts of the world.When I heard that there was an Austrian song queued up on Spotify but that no one was paying attention, in fact people were starting to leave, I decided to change it.At that point the Austrian boy, who knew Italian, shouted at me ""what are you doing, whore"".At that moment I was shocked, because I wasn't even doing anything that would make him think of that word.He means that he chose her because he knows that he would make me feel belittled.I also told him what he actually meant to understand if perhaps he had simply translated wrong or if perhaps he had said it wrong, but instead he confirmed to me that it was exactly what he meant.I felt really belittled, crushed and even the others around me didn't say anything, in fact they laughed because it's definitely funny to call a girl a ""whore"".it is one of those insults that are said lightly but which weigh heavily on the person to whom they are addressed.",1
"It's an uncomfortable topic to discuss... but the first time I received a sexist insult was from a girl (well, of the same sex as me), at a too young age.We were only in middle school and the reason for her insult was because the boy she was interested in liked me.Even though I have never done anything and have always been reserved, she freely insulted me behind my back calling me a ""whore"".I felt bad and guilty, even though I shouldn't have because I didn't do anything wrong.But she was also my friend and she's a girl like me... we were little and she certainly still didn't understand the gravity of her words.This is why I believe it is important to defend women, always, and explain to children that certain things have meanings and that they can lead to unpleasant situations.",1
"and we are at my mother's house to celebrate with all the family.There is my sister-in-law, who is of Russian origin, who has been trying for several hours to convince my husband and my brother-in-law to go to the gym and she makes a silly sexual comment causing laughter from those present.In a short time the situation degenerates, I go to try to calm things down with my daughter and I am attacked by my sister-in-law who shouts in my face that we are a rude family and tries to put her hands on my daughters who are responding to the insults making the youngest cry.I am blinded by anger and I give in even though she is 190 cm and weighs 100 kgthen my brother intervenes",1
It happened at work.I'm on the phone with one of our salespeople to report a problem I can't resolve with one of his customers.I did everything I could to resolve the matter but according to the seller I wasn't determined enough so he tells me that I'm just a spineless scribbler that I've pissed him off and that when he comes back he'll report to the owner and give me a damn,1
"I'm in line waiting for my turn to access the room where the theater show in which a friend of mine is performing will be held.After a few minutes, two other friends from the same group join me and I start a conversation with them.I'm wearing a jacket-dress almost to the knee, without a neckline, and pointed shoes with about 4 centimeter wide heels.We are in the main square of the city surrounded by other people who will be watching the show, when unexpectedly a boy, probably a teenager, certainly younger than me, looks at me, whistles and calls me a whore.I feel disturbed and disappointed",1
"It was evening, around 7pm during last winter, so it was darkand I was walking near a shopping center in Milan.While I was walking I was talking on the phone to a friend of mine who I know because she came with me to high schooland I see a group of at least 4 kids approaching, who must have been around 15/16 years old (I was 17 at the time).I see them staring at me and they start whistling at me as if I were a dog, I'm scared because I was 1 against 4 and I speed up my pacebut I feel that they continue to comment.I continue walking, telling the situation on the phone to my friend who tells me to ignore them and leave as quickly as possible.They continue to follow me but seeing that I don't consider them, they start calling me a bitch.I felt humiliated and then later angry that passersby didn't even stop to say anything.",1
I was in Bratislava and in a pub I wasn't given a table just because I was the only diner.I was told there wasn't even a seat and the family behind me was calmly given a table.The waiters who initially pretended not to see me didn't even wait for me to come out to seat those who were after me and they shrugged their shoulders at me while also pretending not to be able to speak English.,1
"I was having dinner with some friends.We were talking about minorities and, according to one of those present, these minorities must not behave in certain ways.To which I very calmly explained to him that his point of view could be incorrect as he speaks as a privileged person who can afford to do more or less what he wants.We exchanged a series of other answers, always in calm tones, but at a certain point he got angry and began to raise his voice, so much so that another friend present had to intervene to make him calm down.I felt more humiliated because I felt attacked by the things he was saying and",1
"I was at work, I had my doubts about transferring one of my tasks to another person because it was something I knew they wouldn't be able to do or in any case they would continue to cause damage or ask for every single thing, so I exposed my reasons to the boss who, instead of telling me his reasons and dealing with the matter normally, started shouting and insulting me.Obviously I did as he said and the result was as we expected.So now he thinks that the other person will do the job when he himself isn't capable and I have to do it myself.Without him knowing or ranting again.",1
"I was at a fast food restaurant, waiting for my friend to join me at the table.In the room there was a very tall, overweight man who was eating alone and looking at his cell phone: I looked around for an amuchina dispenser and caught his eye several times.At a certain point I instinctively perceived that the man felt as if he were being stared at by me and I felt that I had made him uncomfortable perhaps because he was alone or perhaps because of his appearance.So I exaggerated my 'searching' look with the hope of making him understand that I was looking for something else and I also commented out loud that I hadn't been able to find any amuchina when my friend joined me at the table.Outside the restaurant, after a long time, I was talking to my friend and absentmindedly my gaze met that of the man.I was scared thinking that he had remained outside waiting for me (as he had eaten the meal upon our arrival at the restaurant ).Imust have widened my eyes and he approached in a very dangerous way shouting 'have you finished looking at me??you've been doing it for half an hour.'I got scared and asked my friend to move us away because I feared for",1
"I was at a concert with my cousin who had recently undergone foot surgery and was therefore forced to use crutches to participate in the event.At the end of the concert a steward very kindly suggested we use a secondary exit with a stair lift to facilitate my cousin's exit from the theatre.We accept with thanks.After a few minutes the stair lift attendant reaches us and addresses us with sufficient and arrogance, it seemed as if our need at that moment had disturbed him.this behavior of his made me really angry, because you don't approach people this way, especially",1
"I was at the bar with some friends and I saw that another of our friends was arriving outside the door so I looked at her and started smiling and saying hello.On the edge of the door there were other girls who thought I was being silly and saying hello to them and then laughing because I was saying hello to them, then they started insulting me and giving me dirty looks.At that moment I was scared because I thought they would come near me to seek a confrontation or insult me ??even more.",1
"I was driving, I was about to enter a rather narrow roadand I had the right of way when suddenly a car cuts in front of me and is forced to stop because another car was passing in front, then this person driving starts shouting and offending everyone those present in the cars in a bad way, the moment he turns and looks at me in the face, addressing me in that way, he really made me very angry",1
"I was at my graduation presentation and I was in the middle of the speech when some members of the commission started talking to each other, without even whispering too much.At a certain moment my supervisor even gets up and leaves the room and then comes back after a minute, sitting down again as if nothing had happened.I don't think I've ever witnessed more rude and uncaring behavior in a similar situation.I almost felt cheated, as if my work didn't count for anything, as if I was just a number.",1
"I was at the GP doctor's office.She had argued with the previous patient and when I went she was shouting at me and answering badly as if she had done something, at a certain point I tell her that if she had argued it wasn't my problem and that please she must respond politely because I hadn't done anything.I was very calm because I knew it wasn't my fault but after a while of him answering me badly I started to feel insulted so I said what I thought was right without having to argue too",1

"I was in the car, when I was entering a main road I hesitated because there was a lot of traffic, the car behind me started honking its horn, making offensive gestures and shouting insults.Initially I didn't give much thought to it, but then I responded by playing too.After I entered the road, the car overtook me and even went across the road, blocking the column.I got very agitated and scared, because I understood that the person was altered and not completely himself.I closed the windows and doors and I stopped.",1
"I was in line for the blood test, waiting for my turn.Once I filled out the acceptance sheets I had to wait for them to call me to carry out the actual exam.But they started calling the numbers after mine, skipping me.I calmly and calmly pointed this out to the nurse and she, annoyed, went to check, she realized she had made a mistake, but she was rude and arrogant, making me feel wrong.This situation made me exclude that place for the blood tests from that day...I felt helpless and badly treated without any sense",1
I was in line to get into a nightclub and some drunk guys passed my group of friends and called us “whores”.She made me feel like I was a rag thrown on the floor and nothing more than a being for the purpose of sex.I was so shocked that I didn't have the strength to respond,1

"I was on a bus with some sommeliers, because we were going to a fair.Next to me was my boyfriend and in the seat in front of me my best friend was sitting with her.We hadn't seen each other for a long time, so from the moment we left and for the next two hours of the journey, she always talked: about her, about her life, about her problems.Let's point out that my friend is very self-centered.At a certain point, I thought of something to tell my boyfriend for the next day; and my friend got angry, and she called me a ""bitch"" because for a certain reason for a",1

"I was on holiday with some friends and we were 16 at the time.we were guests of a family, but the house was not in good condition, so my mood was very low because of this and every little thing bothered me.One day we had to go out to eat and I wasn't ready yet, but my friends were, so they walked out the bedroom door and started going down the stairs without me.I started crying and asked why they weren't waiting for me and one of them called me a pain in the ass.They then came down and waited for me at the door of the house.",1
"I was very depressed because of the family situation I live in, and I dated this guy.He just wanted to take advantage of me, and when he said to me, ""do you want to do something?""and I didn't answer right away, he said ""you took too long to give me an answer"", and when I hesitated he told me that's what all women want because we're all whores.I felt very bad and hurt, because not only was I in a difficult personal situation, but because it was a very profound offense.Also afterwards he told me to go out with him because having a nice ass, his friends would give him more weed to smoke for bringing a beautiful girl.In all this I have never smoked..",1
"I was on the street and I was looking at my phone while I was crossing, a car suddenly braked because it hadn't seen me and the driver shouted an insult at me.At first I felt frozen, then I realized that I too was wrong since I wasn't looking where I was going.In any case, I also thought afterwards that he could avoid insulting like that, because all he had to do was honk his horn if he really wanted to show his anger.",1
"I was on one of those Christmas trains, luckily in the company of friends, and there was a group of quite annoying kids, they started making jokes and to a certain one I replied in kind to stop.Then they started to get even more agitated and consequently so did I, they started the usual insults ""you're a whore"" etc... I was very pissed offbut I had to calm down so as not to make the situation worse.After a while I got off the train.",1
"I am 13/14 years old and I am at the oratory after catechism.I'm one of the few girls while the boys are an entire football team who enjoy teasing me by calling me ""pompinatrix"".It all started from a ""joke"" about the fact that since I have braces, according to them, getting a blowjob from me should be an unpleasant experience.I react by getting angry and insulting them back, trying not to seem humiliated and dejected.I can't explain why you would treat another person like that",1
"I just finished dinner with my family and it's time to clear the table.The division of labor between me and my brothers is ambiguous and a small argument breaks out between me and my younger brother.After some discussion he calls me a bitch and a slacker.I didn't feel particularly offended given the not too serious context, but I certainly wasn't pleased.",1
"I just finished arguing with the person I thought was my best friend.We are unable to have a direct confrontation, but the argument takes place via chat.We are during high school exams and I don't want to waste time keeping up with a stupid argument that has made me really understand what kind of person I'm dealing with.At the end of the conversation she calls me a bitch because I didn't tell her the truth when I explained the situation to her several times and what she thinks didn't happen.This insult doesn't particularly affect me because I have a clear conscience and I have no reason to feel attacked, as I know how things went but she doesn't want to believe me",1
"I had an accident at work and had to call the inbox to book the visit.The secretary responded to me in a very rude way, accusing me of being disrespectful just because I asked if it was possible to make an appointment (I didn't know it couldn't be done), I felt at fault and uncomfortable",1

"I met Marco and told him that I hadn't remembered to bring him the keys to the scooter he had lent me and he told me :""you're still the same stupid bitch"".I suddenly felt very angry, I would have slapped himbut I held back and smiled at him.It was very difficult but he made me feel superior to him and so I was a little better",0
"I met what I thought was a friend because she wanted to tell me things.I am quite annoyed by her typical victimism and egocentrism which hardly leads her to understand the difficulties of others, because everyone has to direct all their energy and attention to her.She starts accusing me of not being available, that she can never contact me, that I never reply to her messages.Which is often nonsense while I'm at work.Particularly annoyed by her lack of understanding of her, especially because I have serious personal problems, I tell her I'm not sitting on the couch waiting for her stupid texts and she yells at me that I'm an insensitive bitch.Since there is no margin for understanding, she leaves me",1
"I argued with my father, to defend my mother.I was calm, he started insulting me and yelling at me to shut up.I didn't think about staying quiet at all, on the contrary, I urged him verbally, without ever insulting him or shouting.He approached me threateningly and said ""you're an ungrateful bitch, if you continue I'll slap you"".Which then actually happened.I pushed him away, he was surprised by the strength I had put into it, because he backed away a lot.I continued to be calm, but my words were not very kind.This went on for several minutes, until my brother got in the way and separated us.",1
"I gave birth a day ago and my roommate, in front of lunch, starts making strange faces and saying it sucks.When talking about work she is haughty and speaks with a tone of superiority, as if she is better than others.When I explain to her what job I do (public administration) she makes a disgusted face, as if my job was simple and I was a lazy person.",1

"I am walking on the street in Enschede, at daytime with a friend of mine.It is not a quiet street per se, but it is also not busy.We pass two men who already look a bit sketchy.I feel uncomfortable immediately.They make a comment about how our asses look.Something like; ""your asses look so good girls"".I feel threatened and scared that they are going to say more or that they are coming after us.We walk on and I feel very relieved that they don't follow us and it was just one comment.I can handle that, but I do not feel safe or comfortable.",1
"I'm standing in the road waiting for a taxi when a car passed by and some guy shouted from the window ""Bitch, do you want to fuck?"".I can't believe what I just heard.I am feeling disgusted and uncomfortable.I am worried what people around me might think.It's moments like these that make me hate the fact that I am a woman.I just want to go home and cancel all my plans for the day.",1
"Yesterday, at work, I had an unpleasant exchange with a person I had never met in person, who deliberately insulted me via email.He didn't use explicit swear words but phrases like ""be ashamed"" ""go graze the sheep"" etc.I felt very offended at first, then I thought that on the other side there was definitely a frustrated, ignorant, bad person, so I was reassured by the fact that he was certainly worse off than me, so much so that I no longer gave following the conversation.",1
"My boss called me back because, in a moment of calm and when there was nothing to do (I'm a waitress), I was talking to some of my colleagues who had finished work.He called me aside and told me in a very stern and angry tone that when I'm on working hours he expects me to work and not chat and when faced with my apologies he told me that he didn't want them.I found the situation strange, in fact I didn't feel very guilty as I usually would because I knew there was nothing to be done and that it was just a stance and a request for respect, however I felt very humiliated and uncomfortable, and since my contract would soon expire, it made me very upset.I thought about it for a long time until relations became absolutely cordial again.",1
"I imagine the insult comes from a man who feels bullied, belittled by a woman who has at least as much power, intelligence and courage as he does.My first reaction would be anger and frustration.I would probably respond with an insult and then with a comment aimed at underlining my value and the fact that his insult underlines his smallness even more.Depending on the context, I might even rate the person who made the comment as so insignificant that it doesn't deserve any attention or response and I might simply decide to turn on my heel and walk away.Surely, however, the offense would remain within me and in my mind I would continue to think for a while about my reaction, about what other reactions I could have had and there would remain a desire to be able to hurt at least as much as I felt hurt.",0
"I imagine I'm walking down the street with a friend and we pass a bar, where there are people outside who are drinking.one of these, while moving, bumps into me and starts insulting me with sexist insults.initially I try to move on with my friend, but the guy in question follows us and continues with the insults and it disturbs me a lot, I struggle to keep calm, but I continue to try to move away from",0

"The day before yesterday a nurse from the local health authority gave me a rude answer only because I asked why they were late for the delivery of medical supplies for my mother and I had already gone last week to ask.Simply for the patient's right, just because there were many people for the same reason, he turned to me like this, they who should work with passion towards others who suffer.",1
"The episode concerns a phone call with an administrative secretary of a cooperative for which I carried out training days.I have to fill out some salary documents and I don't understand what information I have to provide.When I asked for information, the lady responded to me in a very rude manner, telling me that I must be able to do this procedure alone and that she cannot keep up with me because she has much else to do.I feel frustrated, as if it were my fault for the lack of knowledge on the subject.In a rude way you also point out to me that the data I have already entered are incomplete or incorrect and that I need to pay more attention to how I fill out the documents.I feel misunderstood, sad, not",1
"The last person to insult me ??during an argument was my brother.I don't even remember precisely what the motivation for the argument was, but I remember very well the sense of humiliation and offense I felt.Initially the reaction was to respond to the offense with a further insult, only to then realize that I would only have made things worse.I felt so hurt that I started crying and, even more so, I didn't want to continue the discussion.I walked away and let it go.",1
"the last time someone called me a dick was my girlfriend during our fight.I honestly believe that my next instinct was to tell her ""whatever, you are an idiot"" explaining her reasons.Calling myself an idiot hurts me because everyone thinks I'm a very naive person who lets things get in their way, when in reality many times I don't care much about what others say or what they think and, in reality, I know how to defend myself very well with words.When this happened, I got furious and responded to her in kind, both of us continuing like this, then the argument went a little further from what we were saying in the beginning.",1
"The last time someone addressed me in a rather rude manner was a few months ago, in May to be exact.My former employer yelled at me, in front of dozens of other people, insulting me in every way he could think of.After years of seemingly appreciated work, I have suffered professional and private attacks for reasons well beyond the limits of an employee.A ""man"" (if I can define him that way) 1.90m tall who made so much effort to shout and gesticulate that he was so red that he was encouraged by",1
"The last time someone called me a general insult was a few months ago during an argument with my then-boyfriend.I don't remember the precise words he used but I remember that I felt hurt by the use of the insult, but no more than I was already hurt and destabilized by the discussion and the situation of tension and conflict in general.I probably responded by returning the insult.",1
"The last time, that I'm aware of, that someone called me a sexist insult was maybe 4 years ago.The event happened when I was at a disco with some of my friends.We were having fun with each other, dancing and laughing.Suddenly, however, some guys came closer to us with the intention of talking to us.My friends and I didn't want to be bothered by them, also because the boys had perhaps drunk too much.After a while of my friends and I trying to distance ourselves from the boys in question, one of them started insulting us using thick terms precisely because we didn't want their ""attention"".",1
"My colleague turned to me underlining the late hours at which she usually leaves, it made me feel both sorry for her and very angry because our positions are not even remotely comparable, starting from the compensation and the role held.For the rest of the day my mood was always a little ""stopped"" because I would have liked to be able to respond in kind or at least underline my extraneousness to the situation, but it seems that many times things are the same, that there is no boundary line between what people can say regardless of how the words may affect the interlocutor.Perhaps the other person's excessive education leads others to behave like this.",1
"I worked as a bartender in a summer establishment and wore a tank top.An elderly client, as soon as he saw my cleavage, started calling me ""stood mare"" and explicitly telling me what he wants to do with me in very vulgar terms.",1
"I work at the airport at the security checks, a lady asks me if it was possible not to let her daughter go through the metal detector as she is wearing an infusion pump.I have been doing this job for 8 years and it has happened to me several times that people have passed by with this object, no one has ever caused any problems under the metal detector, so I still ask the lady to show me the medical certificate attesting that for her health she cannot she can pass, but I don't read any of this, so I invite the girl to pass and carry out the checks normally.The mother then tells her to go through the metal detector because otherwise ""they would have missed the flight"", and she goes away screaming in my ear ""Fuck you, bitch!"", I hate these situations because I'm in a workplaceand therefore I I limit myself to calling the police, with a great sense of bitterness.",1
I work in the hotel world and I often get greeted by guests.Here's the situation: I'm talking to a guest who has a reservation for 6 nights and her reservation was handled by a fashion house.In this case we do not speak with the direct guest but with whoever contacted us to make the reservation for the guest.The guest tells me that in reality her stay is for 3 nights and not 6 and that the fashion house made a mistake.I explain to him that you don't have to talk to us but to the fashion house and that in any case your reservation is penalized and you have to pay the 3 extra nights.The guest gets angry and tells me that she seems like bullshit to him and insults my facility and me.He tells me that I don't know how to do my job and that I don't know how to handle the situation.He calls me stupid and incapable.I honestly felt very debased and insulted even though it wasn't my fault but hers as she knew the cancellation policy.In the end I managed approx,1
"I send a WhatsApp message to a girl in the gymnastics class to remind her that her entrance card has expired and needs to be renewed.She replies that she hasn't used an entrance and it seems absurd to her to have to lose it, she says that after all the season ticket expired only one day ago and concludes with the words: ""how tax are you, my goodness!!!!I really feel like I'm immersed in an unreal situation....and I think ""but is this one really complaining and judging me in a negative way because I asked her to renew an expired subscription?""",1
"Marco has just seen me at the disco, I'm dancing with my friends, in my way which is certainly a little provocative, but which he has always liked.I'm not talking or looking at any man, I'm just dancing.He arrives like a rocket, makes space between my friends and tells me 'you're such a whore', and then leaves, without even giving me time to respond.I'm furious, my friends are stunned, their looks, some furious like me, but some with that mixture of commiseration",1
"A few months ago it happened to me that I was treated very rudely by a patient who immediately addressed me on first terms from the beginning of the visit, demanding that tests and medications be prescribed quickly, which according to him were documents given that the visit started ten minutes late and that I, I imagine as a young woman, was not the type of doctor he expected to find.Very rude, she started to raise her voice, I found it very difficult to remain calm.",1
It happened to me in the car while I was driving.A person I rang because he didn't give me priority insulted me and called me an idiot.At that moment I felt angry because I received an insult knowing I was right at that moment,1
"It happened to me in a club a few years ago.I was dancing on the floor with some friends and some guys came up to us and rubbed up against us in an absolutely unsolicited way.We stopped dancing and asked them - in an annoyed manner - to stop with that unsolicited behavior.Since the boys didn't listen to us, we moved away into the crowd on the track, and this prompted them to address sexist insults to us.",1
"It happened to me on the street a few years ago.I was sitting on a bench with a friend and a Nigerian boy approached us and wanted to sell us some junk.I told him politely that I wasn't interested and he replied to us in English saying that we were prostitutes.Out of anger, without thinking twice I replied that the real whores were his mother and sister.He left in a hurry and I felt so angry and I would have gladly thrown something at his head.",1
"I imagine that it could be a male person, perhaps during an exchange or a heated argument.it could be a person I know more or less well.If I imagine being directed at a sexist insult like the ones mentioned above, I don't think I would have any particular reaction.Even reading them they don't make me feel discouraged or anything else.Having never found myself in such a situation and struggling to even imagine it, I don't know what else to add.I just imagine it could happen in a mom",0
I remember showing up at a job interview for a clothing and accessories shop in my city and the person in charge of my interview looked at me up and down and told me very clearly that they wouldn't take me because I was overweight and the shop wouldn't have made a good impression with me in it.,1

"I'm dating a man a little older than me, who makes me feel safe and who I consider mature, responsible etc... Or at least that was my first impression.In reality, he pushes for a relationship that I don't want, to even have a child, and to do things in bed that I don't like...So I decide to take my life back by saying: ""no, enough"".Here the insults begin: he starts calling me a ""whore"", says I took advantage of him...I never asked for anything!The most he did was pay for the dinners, but then he left",1
"I'm saying goodbye to some friends at the end of a beautiful evening.When I'm leaving the club a man turns around and insults me.It is a somewhat old man, 50 years old, drunk.I get scared and call my friends.I ask them if they can take me home since I no longer feel safe doing these 10 minutes on foot.I feel attacked, offended.Another thing I'm thinking is that I wouldn't want something like this to happen to any of my other friends but there's nothing I can do to stop this man from doing the same thing to other girls.And words are just the beginning.I know how quickly a situation like this can escalate and lead to a different end.I am happy to be with my friends with whom I feel protected.",0

"He found me in the living room with my younger sister, we were arguing because a misunderstanding had arisen between us regarding his schoolwork, for which he had asked me for help.During the discussion she exclaimed ""you're such a bitch"" but I didn't take this as an insult, at that moment I was so angry that hearing that sentence shocked me even more and I immediately responded with a similar word too.",1
"I was in a shopping center, in a relaxation area with sofas.I see on the sofa in front of mine a man (even if calling him such seems too pretentious to me) who is smoking a cigarette, even though it is forbidden indoors.Not happy with this he puts out his cigarette in the pot of a plant.I definitely got a disdainful expression when I witnessed the scene, he sees me and starts threatening me, telling me ""you don't know who I am, I'm in charge of the security of this shopping centre, you have to shut up and look away, you're alone a little girl, don't you have a boy who can keep you at bay?""making me feel scared, humiliated, frustrated.I didn't feel safe responding to this bully, because I thought he might hurt me, therefore both rude and dangerous.",1
"I was in the car a stone's throw from my house and I was crossing a small stretch against traffic because no car was coming from the opposite side.A couple who were walking their dog blocked my way by standing in front of my car and insulting me.I was wrong, I apologized several times, the mistake was all mine, but the way",1

"It makes me think of my roommate who never lets me finish talking and often interrupts my conversations, even though she may have been the one to ask me about something.The last time was last night, when she asked me to tell her how my boyfriend's birthday party went (a surprise party I had organized).I had just started the story when she immediately interrupts me to tell me a fact about herself (unsolicited and absolutely irrelevant at the moment).I find it very rude not to respect speaking turns, interrupt people, but above all",1

"During high school, I was in my second year and therefore I was around 15 years old, one day there was a teachers' meeting with parents to talk about school progress.At that time I had a very very particular English teacher, she wasn't very educational, a bit weird and easily insulted.but I knew that if I didn't bring my mother to talk to her, she would be very angry.So, I take my mother to her, already warning her of the type, and the teacher, when talking about me, describes me as a ""dead cat"" only because during recess I went up to the upper floors to talk to my other friends.By ""dead cat"" she meant that I liked talking to boys and therefore alluding to the fact that I was some sort of no good, making me look bad in front of my mother.Mum let it go, pretending to listen to herand I did the same thing, even though at that moment I felt very ashamed and almost guilty because I thought ""After leaving the meeting, however, my mother and I had a laugh to lighten things up and above all because I knew, as she also knew, that that insult came from a very frustrated and particular person.",1
"It has never happened to me directly, but indirectly, which is why I selected no; in any case it was very unpleasant nonetheless.I was with a friend at McDonald's for a snack, I was 14 years old and for a few months Charlie, our dog, had become part of our lives, so I took him for a walk with me.I remember we were outside and a boy gave Charlie a compliment, so I politely thanked him with a smile.The boy's response was to turn to his friend and sneer and say: ""Pay the dog a compliment and she'll get wet.""",0
"I don't remember exactly the last time I was called ""bitch"", maybe it hasn't been said to me lately so I'm not talking about the last experience.Rather I can describe the moment when when I was told it hit me so much.It happened about two years ago, and it was told to me by my mother, when during an argument (very frequent in that period)I expressed how I felt, how some people hurt me",1
"I don't remember the last time I was insulted with terms like that, but I will always remember this episode.A neighbor of mine found herself doing obscene acts in a public place in the garage under my house: after telling her to find a more suitable place she left.Today, after a few days, I met her again at her supermarket with her mother: she looked at me very badly the whole time.I pretended nothing happened until she started insulting me, without directing the insult directly at me.So I replied to her and she called me a ""whore"": I remember smiling and replying ""you can tell me anything, but not that"".If I think about it now (understanding that this story seems invented)I both laugh at the absurdity and cry because we women are often the first to use denigrating adjectives against other women.And that's maybe the thing",1
"I don't remember the situation well, it happened a long time ago.I only remember that I was arguing with someone and while we were arguing he insulted me by calling me a ""whore"".I don't remember what we were discussing or the situation in general.But more often I received unwanted ""attention"" while I was walking on the street.",1
I don't remember exactly the last time someone called me a sexist insult,1
"Talking with my high school friends we often discussed various topics.Being a woman of Italian-Romanian origins, it frequently happened to me that insults were addressed to me, such as ""women from the East are all sluts anyway"", sometimes with ironic intent, sometimes in situations involving more heated political discussions, which made me were addressed in the ""heat"" of the moment.I learned growing up to manage my emotions and not fall into their patterns and handle the insults received with maturity.At first I felt deeply offended.Growing up I developed a sort of ""apathy"" towards these insults.",1

"I think the last time was with my brother.we started arguing jokingly and jokingly raising our hands over a small spat (I had eaten some of his yogurt) and he took it too seriously.I thought he was pretending to be angry and that's why I kept laughing and making fun of him until he called me an idiot (usually he never says bad words).I felt hurt and ridiculous, a single word made me feel very bad and left me dumbfounded.I would have preferred her to explain to me what she was feeling at that moment",1
"I think I'm in line for some service and I involuntarily overtake someone who, realizing this, insults me by calling me a bitch.My first thought would be one of disbelief and I would try to quickly understand what was happening.When I understand what happened then in that case I would apologize but I would still invite the other person to use more appropriate and less offensive language.I would try to say it while keeping calm so as not to make the situation worse.The other person could continue to complain and in this case I don't know if I would be able to stay calm and therefore an argument could start.What I imagine, however, is that the other person doesn't get too heated and, realizing that they were initially wrong, they apologize to me in turn.",0
"it could happen for example if I kissed or went with several people, obviously too many for the person who insults me, perhaps someone with whom I have been engaged or not even, or even more likely if someone on the street stopped me to ask for my number and try and I told him no, and as I've seen it happen not to me directly but on video or heard from stories from people I know, often the other person's response is a sexist insult like ""It doesn't matter, you're just a whore.""”, which they certainly wouldn't say to a man and which in this case isn't even appropriate, it's right to say something sexist and inconsistent, which I still find absurd on",0

He asks me to go and clear a table, I go and as I am about to take an empty tray he tells me to lower the tray because the gentleman on my right was still eating.(The gentleman was actually chewing his last bite, but his plate and especially the tray next to him were empty)so the gentleman tells me to take the tray, the owner tells me to put it down.The gentleman tells me again that he's finished and the owner tells me to put it down again.All this in front of an entire room, with me moving my arm as two contenders told me to do.The same owner then shouted at me to go and get the bread, from one point of the room to another ""go and get the bread, run, run"" shouting!And what's more he started criticizing the way",1
"A few years ago I ended an acquaintance with a guy I had only dated twice.After telling him that I didn't want to continue seeing him because I wasn't interested in starting any kind of relationship, the guy in question started insulting me by calling me a whore, saying that he wanted to end things with him ""just to jump on other dicks"".At first I tried to calm him down without success, until I felt tired of his insults and was filled with anger.Anger because I didn't deserve such insults, for not having been understood and at the same time a strong sense of shame for him.Not knowing how to accept and handle rejection, it is extremely shameful to insult the other party in order to feel superior.",1
"A few years ago, in the summer, while I was at the disco with some of my friends, everything was fine and the evening proceeded like any other.when, at a certain point, a boy wanted to dance with me, but I wasn't interested.that's why he and his friends started insulting me by saying ""blowjobs?you have the face of a cocksucker, you're a cocksucker, you're a cocksucker!""
I felt bad, because I hadn't done anything, and the insult was only to make the boy and his friends feel bigger than him, while they wanted to make me feel useless, wrong and in the wrong.but being mature I only felt sorry for these elements, who insult women for feeling macho but then are not even capable of engaging in a meaningful discussion.",1
"A few days my husband and I were called to the hospital because the doctor who deals with my son's health problems wanted to talk to us.Once we arrived there, after having traveled an hour by car and after waiting an hour, said doctor, when he arrived, addressed us in a rude manner (furthermore receiving us in a sort of closet/warehouse) asking in a manner arrogant and ""tell me what you wanted to know?""In saying ""we have nothing to ask..."", without letting us finish speaking he said ""well then we can go too""But how did you call us and treat us this way",1
"A few weeks ago I was going to work like every day.The road that separates me from the place is just five minutes by car, so as usual I stopped at the stop sign at the intersection before my workplace.There was a car that was backing up so it could turn around and park, and within a second the driver accelerated and hit the front of my car.I immediately got out and the lady too, looking at me from head to toe in a haughty manner, pointing out that my father's car was already completely dented and that it certainly wasn't her who had done the damage.I got very nervous, I felt treated like a fool, and out of nervousness I started crying on the phone to my mother.The lady, seeing me, started laughing pretending to console me and this infuriated me further, and then reached the climax when I heard her say to her daughter ""this is stupid"".The surprise, however, came when my father arrived on site and to my great surprise revealed to me that the woman was my mother's cousin.Seeing my father he completely changed his attitude, his haughty and judgmental attitude changed d",1
When I was pregnant I was on the tram and no one wanted to let me sit so I asked a boy if he would give me his seat.He rudely told me that I couldn't see my belly too much since I had a jacket on and he didn't want to get up,1
"This summer I had an experience in which from a situation of reason I found myself being insulted.it was a weekday night (not a weekend) and around 4 in the morning from the window of my room I could hear chants and screams coming from outside, probably drunk guys who continued like this for an hour, to the point that I, who had to waking up the next morning to go to work I went out on the balcony and prayed not to make any more noise that they were waking everyone up... they started insulting me heavily, I lived with my girlfriend and when she went out too we got insulted for sexual orientation, called despicable names, they said I'll beat you, come down and I'll show you...I felt bad seeing a group of kids a few years younger than me behaving in this way.Common sense and education were really lacking, I hadn't insulted anyone and yet I received gratuitous insults, as well as disturbing my sleep throughout the night.",1
"This experience happened about a year ago.I was in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend and it was a time when we were very distant as he had been attending the military academy for about a few months.he has always been a very jealous guy who was always ready to attack me if I intended to go out with my friends in the evening or dance with them.One evening after yet another argument of this type in which he attacked me because I had decided to go out with my friends without his consent (usually I didn't do it because I respected his jealousy)he began to bombard me with phone calls until I I replied and he started insulting me in the worst ways.He told me that I was a whore, that since he was now away at the academy I would go out and have sex with everyone, that I didn't deserve any kind of respect and that I should be ashamed for being an undignified bitch.I felt really disrespected and",1
"This summer I worked in a pharmacy and had taken over from two colleagues with decades of experience in the preparation of galenic drugs and I, without experience, found myself managing everything alone.Being a girl and a young one at that, I was treated with rudeness several times but in particular one lady called me dozens of times claiming that I didn't understand anything because I had asked her for the recipe for the preparation in a certain way (as per the pharmacopoeia ) while she didn't want to listen to what I had to say in any way.She interrupted me several times telling me I had to shut up and at that point I hung up.I imagine you had the preparation done elsewhere.",1
"This horrible experience of mine happened at school when I was 16 years old.There was a mess in the classroom because the teacher wasn't there.They were all throwing paper balls back and forth, when a paper ball hit my head and I told one boy to stop playing with paper balls, and he responded with a series of insults telling me it wasn't him he said I was a whore and prostituted myself on the street, I was practically helpless because I couldn't imagine his reaction.I was advised to go to the council to talk about what happened, I spoke to the director outside and unfortunately his reaction was to do nothing.He said he was sorry for what had happened, but that there was nothing he could do.And I was traumatized and this is one of my thoughts to this day, about how bad I felt that day, and I still have guilt like I was the one who had a bad attitude about ""blaming"" that guy.",1
"I would be very surprised because they are usually insults that are not aimed at older people.then, it depends on who asked me.Sexist or non-sexist ""dirty words"" were, for my generation, almost an interlayer and they weren't paid as much attention as they are today.that said, if it's strangers, maybe I'd have an anger or panic attack that I'd try to contain by leaving as quickly as possible.But if it was a two-person argument with a person close to you, well.I would reciprocate with the same tone and not be offended",0
"I remember very well the last time they spoke to me in a rude manner.One year ago.I had just moved to a different neighborhood and met the owner of a bar, which quickly became my favorite bar.I started hanging out with him (the owner) in a friendly way, but you can see that he had gradually fallen in love with me.After a couple of months, when he came forward and I rejected him, he started insulting me, swearing at me, and talking badly about me to customers.Luckily for me, the people of the neighborhood know him and give him little consideration, but with his words he destroyed me, almost traumatized me.I would say more than rude.",1
"I remember very well when I learned that I had been called a “Slut”.I was 16 years old and my only ""fault"" was that I got engaged for the first time in my life to my first boyfriend with whom I had my first kiss.The worst part of all this was that the insult came from a dear friend of mine.It wasn't said to my face since she this friend was acting normal in my eyes, but she was turned to me behind her back, talking about me to another guy.When I found out I felt terribly guilty even though I had none, and even if I had NEVER had one, a woman should be defined in this way.I felt trampled on, hurt and HUMILIATED.I was afraid that everyone had this idea of ??me, probably dictated by the fact that I was 16 and therefore not mature enough to think clearly.It was a terrible feeling that stayed with me for a long time and even today after 5 years I struggle to talk about it and it hurts me to remember it, almost no one knows.",1
"If I heard a sexist insult addressed to me by a stranger, perhaps passing by on the street, I would feel very humiliated but I would probably pretend nothing had happened and try to walk away as quickly as possible because I would feel a sense of fear towards that person and what they might do.If, however, an insult of this type was addressed to me by a person dear to me or otherwise known, then I would not let the matter go unnoticedbut I would certainly get upset and make people understand the gravity of the insult.",0

"Situation (happened 2 days ago): I am an intern in an events agency.We rent iPads for an event that need to be returned and they task me with packing.Facts: I package the package but I wanted confirmation from the courier that everything was ok because honestly, 4 iPads at my expense and I earn two lire, no!She rings the courier, the secretary answers and tells him to come in because she doesn't know what it is.She looks at us as if to say who it is that she wants that she must do.With a slightly annoyed tone because anyone enters the office because it's a stone's throw away from the door I tell them ""let them in""

She “how dare you, I haven't even worked here for 7 years.Now I'm pissed.And he falls silent

I explained to her that I needed him to confirm that I had done everything correctlyShe doesn't talk to me all day

"I have suffered from very bad migraines since I was little.In my final year of university, a professor who saw me having difficulty finishing the exam told me that I could go to the university's disabled desk for help and, given my chronic illness which involves various problems, I was entitled to have benefits such as more time for the exam.When I went to this office, the lady in charge humiliated me by telling me that with my health problems it was useless to force myself and try to graduate (which I subsequently did) and that I should look for a husband who would support me in order to be a housewife.for life, because I wouldn't be able to do a job in the future anyway",1

"I am arguing with a friend, who, after several misunderstandings, turns to me shouting and with very accusatory and at times contemptuous tones.I immediately start to respond angrily too, especially in response to the very strong and, in my opinion, disproportionate words that she uses.As the conversation progresses, I try to adjust my tone of voice, asking her to lower it as well.She turns to me with real insults, totally disproportionate to the extent of the situation, accusing me of having engineered this whole situation just to hurt her.I feel very hurt and understand that the conversation is totally useless.While I try to reason with her, accept her anger and ask her for clarification, she attacks me in a very aggressive way with the sole intent of hurting me and no intention of really resolving the issue.",1
"I'm arguing with a colleague about some communication problems with her, or rather, I'm complaining about the lack of communication and consideration towards me.I feel very uncomfortable because the colleague doesn't seem cooperative and in fact she tells me that she has never had any problem like this at work and goes to call her superior, with whom she has a friendly relationship, who appears in front of me defending her colleague without knowing anything about what happened and calls me incapable.I feel confused and very uncomfortable",1
"I'm discussing a deadline issue with a colleague.She asks me for help that I can't give and she verbally attacks me, calling me a ""selfish whore"".Not understanding the reaction and not having voluntarily created discomfort, I feel vulnerable but at the same time defective and guilty

Immediately afterwards I feel a state of nervousness rising as I find an aggressive reaction of this type inexplicableI understand, however, that there is something I don't know and I try to stay calm and find a comparison to bring it back",0
"I'm arguing with a friend of mine because I've noticed for some time that she's avoiding me and so I decide to clarify the situation but we quickly lose control and she tells me that I'm a selfish bitch and that I was also jealous of the fact that she she had a boyfriend.I feel frozen, they have never said something like that to me and I certainly didn't expect it from a person like you, who I consider a close friend of mine.Since then we have cut ties and I'm happy we did, she never really apologized to me for what she said to me and I never sought her out",1
"I'm doing group work where I need to make a graph.I'm starting to do it to make the work easier for two girls who are more skilled in the graphics part.As soon as they saw the still unfinished graph, one of the drafts said to me 'well it definitely needs to be reviewed, it sucks'I took it a lot because it's something I feel I'm at fault for.It wasn't even well-crafted feedback or constructive criticism, just a judgment without specifying the 'what'.It bothered me quite a bit.",1
"I'm managing teenagers and their families who are weighing their suitcases before a trip the boys/girls will take without families.One of them has a suitcase that is too heavy and I ask the girl and her family to remove something so that the suitcase is within the limits.The father starts yelling at me, telling me that I have no right to tell them what to do with the suitcase.",1
"I'm driving and a car cuts me off.I get scared and honk at the other driver.He starts gesticulating, but continues, until stopping a few meters ahead at the red traffic light.After a few seconds he gets out of the car and starts shouting insults at me, slamming his fist on my window.He goes on for 30 seconds, in which I am petrified by the reaction, then he gets back into his car and drives off again.",1
"I'm driving on a street I don't know well, I come to a stop sign and I stop.Visibility is compromised by a curve so I take some time to look.I set off again calmly and find a car pulling up alongside me behind me and the woman behind the wheel starts insulting me.I feel lost, I don't understand what she is telling me and why.I feel that anything I say will be of no use, I feel that the anger he is taking out on me is too great to be just a reaction to my way of driving.But I'm scared of her verbal fury and I lock myself away.When I try to apologize if I did something I didn't realize, she calls me an idiot.",1
"I'm driving the car.I stop at a stop sign.There is traffic and the car I should give way to remains stopped because the driver is using his cell phone and did not notice that the cars in front of him were moving forward.So I move forward a little and, a little at a time, I try to enter.The driver of the car I'm supposed to give way to is always on the phone.At a certain point, when I had practically entered the car, the driver of that car looked up and suddenly accelerated, almost rear-ending me, and had the courage to shout ""bitch"" at me.I'm tempted to get out of the car and yell at himbut I'm a little scared of these situations and who I might find on the other side.I therefore refrain from starting a discussion and proceed, thinking however that it is not right to receive insults for free.I feel very angry.",1
"I'm working in the theater as a theater assistant.My job is also to seat the guests and, in today's case, to seat the most influential people in the front seats and the others in the back seats.I approach two boys standing at the back of the room to tell them that there are some seats left in the front, if they want to sit there.One of them responds to me in a very rude way, telling me that those seats can also remain empty, so the organizers (the influential people) will make a bad impression.He's been in this business ""long before me.""
I would like to answer him that I have been working there for 5 years and that if he doesn't want to sit he can also leave because for safety everyone should be seated.Instead I smile for the occasion and leave.",1
"I'm working on the computer, I just finished sending an email requesting payment for a service rendered.The recipient of the email replies, threatening to sue the company I work for and sue us for damages (who knows what).I get angry, his anger is unfounded, he is the one who is in default having not yet paid us for a service.I talk about it with my boss, who tells me to let it go because he is a long-standing customer of the company.I feel helpless, I talk about it with my colleagues and they also think like me and I don't understand how anyone can give in to the blackmail of a madman.",1

"I'm working as a receptionist in a hotel.A customer has been in the hotel for a week, but I always see her angry or annoyed.She always addresses me and my colleagues in a rude manner.She had to leave today, she checked out.My colleague, who has been here recently and is still learning, made her pay the room bill yesterday, forgetting to charge her for extra things (like drinks, snacks, bike rental, etc.).We had seen the client leave a little while ago.So I call her phone to tell her that she forgot to pay part of her bill.She starts yelling at me on the phone (in German) that we are thieves and that she had already paid for everything.I insist by telling her that, since she had two rooms, she had paid for one in full, while the other was missing the extras.I tell you that you can also provide us with a bank transfer, after we have sent you the receipt with the amount spent.She tells me that she was still close to the hotel and that she would come to resolve the situation in person.She comes in angry and she starts yelling at me, she tells me that I don't know how to do my job, that I should leave, that I don't know how to work.She printed out a copy of her bill, showing her what she had left to pay.She calms down in two seconds, she pays me and leaves.",1
"I'm working like every Thursday during the midday shift, I'm a waitress in a restaurant that also has a bar counter.the room is full and I don't stay still for a moment, with people entering, dishes to be brought and tables to be cleared.the bell has just rung to indicate that a dish is ready to serve.I head towards the kitchen and a gentleman at a table calls me rudely ""oh""; I turn around to see if he was mad at me.the aforementioned gentleman, who had just finished eating what he had on his plate, rudely tells me: ""can you make me a coffee"", without even a please or a smile.I take the empty plate away from him, I go to the kitchen to get the plate to bring to the table and as I pass by the table with the nice gentleman, he says to me ""remember my coffee"".",1
"I am working in silence together with my 4 colleagues in the factory.Our worker leader arrives at a brisk pace and pissed off and starts shouting every possible insult imaginable at us, with a particular fixation towards goats in full Vittorio Sgarbi style.From his point of view we had made a mistake in a part of the work which would have cost him a good scolding from the owner, since he was responsible for our work, but we were doing",1

"I'm talking to some friends about an argument that I'm not involved in, but my friend is.We are sitting near the subway and discussing.I try to talk, but one person in particular keeps talking over me and interrupting me.I feel very hurt by this person's unreasonable attacks, also because it is a very stupid argument, a skirmish between friends, but instead he makes it bigger than he is, with the intent of hurting everyone.While I try to speak to calm the situation, in a kind way without attacking or raising my voice, he starts yelling at me saying that I'm a dog and that I'm stupid and I'm worthless because I don't have any thoughts of my own, when instead I was just trying to point out the stupidity of the things they were discussing and I was simply trying to smooth things over.I felt very hurt, betrayed by this person's behavior",1
"I've been talking to Gino, my friend for years and after a series of times in which I refused to go out on weekends, he starts insulting me.“You're such an idiot!”

"I'm talking to my boss about a task he assigned me.The deadline for the performance falls on Sunday.I'm telling him that I can finish the task and send the output to the appropriate person by Friday afternoon (the Friday immediately before the deadline).He replies that he cannot verify the adequacy of the output before Sunday morning, so I would have to wait until Sunday morning to send it to the appropriate person.I reply that I'm out of town at the weekend and can't work.At that point he replies: ""I'm not paying you to indulge in your lascivious pastimes on the weekend.I didn't hire you thinking that you were so worldly, and by worldly I don't mean easy-going, eh..."".I felt deeply offended and violated by some completely gratuitous and unreasonable allusions since I was willing to finish the task well within the deadline and any possible delay depended only on his unavailability to work on it before Sunday.",1
